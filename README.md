## 🔍 Abstract
This research paper investigates the systematic development and optimization of an aluminum-air battery as a potential alternative energy source for emergency situations, such as power shortages. Using a foundational "MacGyver-Battery" as a starting point, the study explores how various modifications to the anode, cathode, and electrolyte influence the battery's efficiency and electrical output. Through a series of controlled experiments, the researchers evaluated different cathode materials—including carbon rods, charcoal brushes, and BBQ charcoal—finding that BBQ charcoal provides the most stable voltage and current over time due to its porus structure. Comparisons between anode materials revealed that aluminum plates are superior to aluminum foil, offering significantly higher short-circuit currents and more stable voltage under load.
The study further demonstrates that increasing the surface area of the electrodes and the concentration of the potassium hydroxide electrolyte significantly enhances performance. Testing multi-cell configurations confirmed that while connecting cells in series increases total voltage, the total contact surface area remains the most decisive factor for power delivery. The final optimized design comprises several series-connected cells utilizing large aluminum plates, large BBQ charcoal pieces, and a high-concentration potassium hydroxide solution. While identifying limitations regarding long-term stability and electrode corrosion, the paper concludes that the aluminum-air battery is a viable laboratory-scale power source with potential for mobile applications if further developed with protective housing and efficient recycling methods for reaction byproducts.
